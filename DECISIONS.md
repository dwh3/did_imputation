# Architectural Decision Records
- [2025-10-14] ADR-001: v0.1 scope fixed (two-way FE on untreated; cluster-by-id; event-study).
- [2025-10-14] ADR-002: No code/text copied from Stata; upstream is behavioral reference only.
- [2025-10-14] ADR-003: Aggregation weights defined as {nobs, equal, cohort_share} as in SPEC.
- [2025-10-14] ADR-004: Parity tolerances numeric (SPEC/TEST_STRATEGY); seeds grid 100..149 for 50 sims.

[2025-10-14] ADR-005: Parity harness validated; goldens frozen for CI; Stata parity retained as optional/manual job.
