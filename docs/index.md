# didimpute Documentation Overview

Welcome to the didimpute project site. This documentation provides a high-level entry point for economists and applied researchers adopting the imputation-based DID estimator implemented in Python.

## Getting Started

- Install the package via `pip install didimpute` or add optional extras such as plotting (`pip install "didimpute[plot]"`).
- Review the API usage patterns in the repository README (ensure the latest copy is restored locally) and the examples under `examples/`.

## Key References

- **Parity Validation** — see the dedicated page in this site navigation to understand how Python outputs are compared with the Stata benchmark.
- **Specification & Architecture** — consult `docs/SPEC.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the repository for deeper implementation details.
- **Testing Strategy** — `TEST_STRATEGY.md` documents deterministic seeds, tolerance thresholds, and regression guardrails.
