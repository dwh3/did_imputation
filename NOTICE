didimpute (Python) is an original implementation of the imputation-based difference-in-differences estimator.

This repository retains the upstream Stata reference materials under `upstream/git/` for comparison and audit only.
Those Stata files remain under their original licenses and are excluded from the published wheel and source
distribution artifacts for didimpute. Users who need the upstream Stata resources should consult the upstream
project directly to obtain them under the applicable terms.
